<h1 align="center">SYNIX OS - Mini OS</h1>

**SYNIX OS** is a simple, command-line based operating system simulation written in C. It allows file management operations like creating, deleting, renaming, reading, and writing to files, as well as file navigation and memory simulation. It aims to provide an educational experience of OS functionalities and file system management.

## Features  
- **File Management**: Create, delete, rename, read, write, copy, and move files.  
- **File Navigation**: Open and close files with ease.  
- **Memory Simulation**: Simulates memory usage and displays memory status.  
- **Command-line Interface**: Provides a user-friendly command interface for file and memory operations.  
- **System Operations**: Clear the console screen and list files in the current directory.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language**: C  
- **File Operations**: Standard file handling functions (`fopen`, `fclose`, `fread`, `fwrite`, `rename`, etc.)  
- **Memory Management**: Simulated memory allocation using a predefined memory block.  
- **System Operations**: Built-in system commands for file listing and console clearing.  

## How It Works  
1. The user interacts with the system through a command-line interface.  
2. Various commands are provided for managing files, including creating, deleting, renaming, copying, and moving files.  
3. Users can write and read to/from files, and open/close files as needed.  
4. The system simulates memory usage and provides the current memory status.  
5. The console can be cleared, and files in the current directory can be listed.  

## Setup Instructions  
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.  
2. Open the project folder and compile the `synix_os.c` using a C compiler (e.g., `gcc synix_os.c -o synix_os`).  
3. Run the program (`./synix_os`) to start the Mini OS.  
4. Follow the on-screen menu to interact with the OS and perform file operations.
